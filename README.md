# FallingObjects
 Field of falling THREE.js objects

## Installing local server
ES6 modules don't like running locally with file://. Must use a local server to preview. See https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/cdndevs/2016/01/24/visual-studio-code-and-local-web-server/

 1. Open command window and type npm install
 2. To use live preview open command window and type npm start
 This will run lite-server.
 Requires that node.js be installed.
 
# Current tasks
1. Getting object loader to work (working on promise implementation)
    1. Trying to get objects instead of promises.
2. Making the field of falling objects even. (mostly done)
